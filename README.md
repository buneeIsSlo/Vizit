## ‚ú® Features

- Visualize multiple path-finding algorithms such as A\*, Depth First Search, and Breadth First Search
- Generation of mazes with different maze generating algorithms such as Recursive Backtracker, and Prim's Algorithm
- Ability to manipulate start and end nodes to see how the path-finding algorithms perform
- Ability to clean up previous visualizations and quickly re-visualize
- Interactive UI with intuitive controls for easy manipulation of the grid and algorithm settings

## üß∞Tech used

- HTML
- SASS

## üåà Inspiration

My main inspiration for creating this project was [Clement](https://www.youtube.com/@clem), who had displayed his own [path-finding visualizer](https://youtu.be/n4t_-NjY_Sg?t=178). Seeing his work sparked a deep fascination with path-finding algorithms in me, and I knew I had to build one for myself. But I hit a bit of a roadblock because there were gaps in my knowledge that I needed to fill before I could make it happen. So, I took some time to learn about graph algorithms, and it was totally worth it! I put in a lot of effort and dedication, and eventually, I was able to create this app.

## üí° Challenges/Learnings

### Design

Rough Sketch

When designing this application, I wanted to keep the user interface simple and intuitive. So, I came up with the idea to have the control menu on the left and the grid on the right, which worked great on desktop. However, I quickly noticed that this layout didn't work as well on mobile devices.

Initially, I thought of having the control menu slide in from the left on mobile, but then I realized it would block the visualization and prevent users from changing any options while the visualization is running. So, I came up with a toggle menu that expands from the top and has a `max-height` so that it's scrollable.

While it's not a perfect solution, it gets the job done and allows users to interact with the app on mobile devices without any major issues.

### Development

I used a `grid` layout for the entire app(medium to large screens), which made it easier for the visualization grid to resize as the browser window changed size.

Initially, I had planned to use the HTML `canvas` element to create the visualization grid, but I found the process of creating the grid with all the nodes and animations to be extremely tedious and difficult. So, I opted for a slightly less optimal method.

I created a `div` grid container filled with `<button>` elements that acted as nodes, and I applied the `grid__node` class to each button element by default for styling. The state of each node was defined by its subclass; for example, the `empty` subclass represented a node that was free to traverse, while the `wall` subclass represented a node that blocked an algorithm from moving to the next node. This method allowed me to manipulate the state of the nodes using event listeners like `click`, `mousemove`, and more. I also used `data` attributes to add position data to each node.

To make the start and end nodes draggable, I made use of the `dragstart`, `dragover`, and `drop` event listeners. This works well on Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers, but unfortunately, Firefox doesn't support this method yet.
