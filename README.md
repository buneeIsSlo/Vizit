# [Vizit]()

A path finding visualization tool.

## ‚ú® Features

- Visualize multiple path-finding algorithms such as A\*, Depth First Search, and Breadth First Search
- Generation of mazes with different maze generating algorithms such as Recursive Backtracker, and Prim's Algorithm
- Ability to manipulate start and end nodes to see how the path-finding algorithms perform
- Ability to clean up previous visualizations and quickly re-visualize
- Interactive UI with intuitive controls for easy manipulation of the grid and algorithm settings

## üß∞Tech used

- HTML
- SASS
- JavaScript
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- Figma

## üõ£ Roadmap

- [ ] Add option to adjust animation speed to slow down or speed up the algorithm visualization

- [ ] Add controls to start/stop and cancel visualization

- [ ] Add more path-finding and maze generating algorithms

## üåà Inspiration

My main inspiration for creating this project was Clement, who had displayed his own path-finding visualizer. Seeing his work sparked a deep fascination with path-finding algorithms in me, and I knew I had to build one for myself. But I hit a bit of a roadblock because there were gaps in my knowledge that I needed to fill before I could make it happen. So, I took some time to learn about graph algorithms, and it was totally worth it! I put in a lot of effort and dedication, and eventually, I was able to create this app.

## üí° Challenges/Learnings

### Design

When designing this application, I wanted to keep the user interface simple and intuitive. So, I came up with the idea to have the control menu on the left and the grid on the right, which worked great on desktop. However, I quickly noticed that this layout didn't work as well on mobile devices.

Initially, I thought of having the control menu slide in from the left on mobile, but then I realized it would block the visualization and prevent users from changing any options while the visualization is running. So, I came up with a toggle menu that expands from the top and has a `max-height` so that it's scrollable.

While it's not a perfect solution, it gets the job done and allows users to interact with the app on mobile devices without any major issues.

### Development

To-do~
